<strong>Generate, explain, and improve Terraform code with the power of AI.</strong>
</p>

Terrific is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the DevOps workflow by leveraging AI. Users can describe their desired cloud infrastructure in plain English, and Terrific will generate the corresponding Terraform code. The app also provides AI-driven explanations and suggestions for improving existing code.

The application features a secure authentication system, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their work in a protected environment.

### ‚ú® Features
Secure User Authentication: Full sign-up and sign-in functionality powered by AWS Cognito, including social sign-in with Google.

AI Code Generation: Describe infrastructure requirements in natural language (e.g., "Create a secure S3 bucket") and receive ready-to-use Terraform code.

#### AI Code Analysis:

##### Explain Code: 
    Get a detailed, line-by-line explanation of what a piece of Terraform code does.

##### Suggest Improvements: Receive AI-powered suggestions on how to improve the security, performance, or syntax of your code.

##### Responsive UI: A clean, modern, and dark-mode interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

##### Protected API: The backend API is secured, ensuring only authenticated users can access the AI generation services.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project is built with a modern, full-stack JavaScript architecture.

Frontend:

Framework: React

Build Tool: Vite

Language: TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Authentication UI: AWS Amplify UI for React

Backend:

Runtime: Node.js

Framework: Express.js

AI Service: Google Gemini API

Authentication:

Service: AWS Cognito

### üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Node.js (version 18 or later)

Git

An AWS Account

A Google Cloud Platform Account (for the Gemini API key)

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/KshitijKhandelwal-Github/Terrific.git

Navigate into the project directory:

cd Terrific

Install dependencies:

npm install

Set up Environment Variables:

This project requires several secret keys and public identifiers to connect to the backend services.

Create a .env file by making a copy of the example file:

cp .env.example .env

Now, open the newly created .env file and fill in the values:

Google Gemini API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY: Get your key from Google AI Studio.

AWS Cognito Variables
You will need to create an AWS Cognito User Pool and an App Client. Follow the project's setup guide or the official AWS documentation.

AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID: The ID of your Cognito User Pool (used by the backend).

VITE_AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID: The same ID, but prefixed with VITE_ for frontend access.

VITE_AWS_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID: The ID of the App Client associated with your User Pool.

Your final .env file should look like this:

# Backend secret keys
GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy...your...gemini...key"
AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID="ap-south-1_xxxxxxxxx"

# Frontend public variables
VITE_AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID="ap-south-1_xxxxxxxxx"
VITE_AWS_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

Run the Application:

You need to run the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminals.

Terminal 1: Start the backend server

npm run start:server

Terminal 2: Start the frontend dev server

npm run dev

Your application should now be running. Open your browser to the local address provided by the npm run dev command (usually http://localhost:5173).

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
This application is ready for deployment to platforms like Vercel, Render, or AWS Amplify Hosting.

When deploying, you do not upload the .env file. Instead, you must configure the environment variables directly in your hosting provider's dashboard. Ensure you set all four variables (GEMINI_API_KEY, AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID, VITE_AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID, and VITE_AWS_COGNITO_APP_CLIENT_ID) in the deployment environment settings.
